## The Burnside process for integer partitions, contingency tables and Sylow p-double cosets.

An implementation of two examples of the Burnside process. 

The file `partitions.jl` implements the reflected and lumped Burnside process for integer partitions.

The file `contingency_tables.jl` implements the lumped Burnside process for contingency tables.

The file `sylow_double_cosets.jl` implement the Burnside process for Sylow \(p\)-double cosets in the symmetric group.

The folder `Examples` contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the use of both Markov chains. The notebooks in this folder can be used to recreate the figures in [Random sampling of partitions and contingency tables: Two practical examples of the Burnside process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02818)
