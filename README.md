## The Burnside process for integer partitions and contingency tables

An implementation of two examples of the Burnside process. 

The file `partitions.jl` implements the reflected and lumped Burnside process for integer partitions.

The file `contingency_tables.jl` implements the lumped Burnside process for contingency tables.

The folder `Examples` contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the use of both Markov chains. The notebooks in this folder can be used to recreate the figures in [Two Examples](arxiv.com)
